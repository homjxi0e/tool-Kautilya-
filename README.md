##### Payloads Compatibility
- The Windows payloads and modules are written mostly in powershell (in combination with native commands) and are tested on Windows 7 and Windows 8. 

- The Linux payloads are mostly shell scripts (those installed by default) in combination with commands. These are tested on Ubuntu 11.

- The OS X payloads are shell scripts (those installed by default) with usage of native commands. Tested on OS X Lion running on a VMWare

##### Usage
Run kautilya.rb and follow the menus. Kautilya asks for your inputs for various options. The generated payload is copied to the output directory of Kautilya.

The generated payload is an arduino sketch, ready to be used with Arduino IDE. Burn it to Human Interface Device of your choice and have fun!

##### Supported Human Interface Devices
In principal Kautilya should work with any HID capable of acting as a keyboard. Kautilya has been tested on Teensy++2.0 and Teensy 3.0 from pjrc.com. Updates about Kautilya can be found most of the times at my blog http://labofapenetrationtester.com/ and google group.

##### User Group
For any queries, discussions and feedback, post to official google group http://groups.google.com/group/kautilya-users or mail me at nikhil d0t uitrgpv at gmail.com 

##### Bugs and Feature requests
Raise an issue or post to the google group.

##### Dependencies
Kautilya needs colored, highline and artii (and win32console on Windows) gems. Use

bundle install


##### Credits
Due Credits and Borrowed Code: I do not put credits of any borrowed code inside the payloads generated by Kautilya to save space. Credits and thanks are generally mentioned either in the description of payloads or accompanying blog post. If you think I missed any due credit, please let me know. I will add the credits with apologies.
